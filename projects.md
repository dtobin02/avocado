# Hackathons

Hackathon projects are mostly prototypes or proofs of concepts at various stages of completeness.

InBatch was a project built at _#Hack4Congress_ in Cambridge. It was a [prototype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hwx8PVUF2SA) of software that helps congressional offices deal with email overload by using topic modeling to automatically sort congressional email.

CampaignCon was a project built for the _Institutional Corruption Hackathon_ at the [Safra Center for Ethics](http://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center-for-ethics/files/lab_booklet.pdf). It pulls the latest FEC records on individual campaign
contributions, compares those records to previous
versions, highlights the differences, and archives
the source FEC files. This tool was intended to help users identify instances in which revisions occur, and how these changes may impact campaigns.
